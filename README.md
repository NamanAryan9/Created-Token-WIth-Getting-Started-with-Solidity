Project Title: 
NFT Token Manager

Simple Overview: 

This smart contract manages a custom NFT token, allowing token creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens to control supply.

Description: 

The NFT Token Manager is a Solidity smart contract designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a straightforward interface for managing a non-fungible token (NFT) supply. The contract includes public variables to store token details, a mapping to track balances, and functions to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. It ensures that tokens can only be burned if the sender has sufficient balance, making it a secure way to handle token supply within the decentralized ecosystem.
